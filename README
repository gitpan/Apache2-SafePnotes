NAME
    Apache2::SafePnotes - a safer replacement for
    Apache2::RequestUtil::pnotes

SYNOPSIS
      use Apache2::SafePnotes;
      use Apache2::SafePnotes qw/pnotes/;
      use Apache2::SafePnotes qw/whatever/;

INSTALLATION
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install

DEPENDENCIES
    mod_perl2

DESCRIPTION
    This module cures a problem with "Apache2::RequestRec::pnotes" and
    "Apache2::Connection::pnotes" (available since mod_perl 2.0.3). These
    functions store perl variables making them accessible from various
    phases of the Apache request cycle.

    According to the docs there are 2 ways to store data as a pnote:

      $r->pnotes( key=>"value" );

    and

      $r->pnotes->{key}="value";

    Unfortunately, these 2 versions work slightly different. Assuming the
    following code

      my $v=1;
      $r->pnotes( 'v'=>$v );
      $v++;
      my $x=$r->pnotes('v');

    I'd expect $x to be 1 but it turns out to be 2. Further on, also this
    code snippet leads to unexpected results:

      my $v=1;
      $r->pnotes( 'v'=>$v );
      $r->pnotes->{v}++;
      my $x=$v;

    Surprise, $x is 2 as well.

    The problem lies in "$r->pnotes( 'v'=>$v )". With "$r->pnotes->{v}=$v"
    all works as expected ("$x==1").

    With "Apache2::SafePnotes" the problem goes away and $x will be 1 in
    both cases.

  INTERFACE
    This module must be "use"'d not "require"'d. It does it's work in an
    "import" function.

    use Apache2::SafePnotes
        creates the function "Apache::RequestRec::safe_pnotes" as a
        replacement for "pnotes". The old "pnotes" function is preserved
        just in case some code relies on the odd behavior.

    use Apache2::SafePnotes qw/NAME/
        creates the function "Apache::RequestRec::*NAME*" as a replacement
        for "pnotes". If "pnotes" is passed as *NAME* the original "pnotes"
        function is replaced by the safer one.
